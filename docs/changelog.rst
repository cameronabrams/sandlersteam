Breaking Changes Policy
-----------------------

sandlercubics follows semantic versioning:

* **MAJOR** version (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes
* **MINOR** version (0.X.0): New functionality, backwards-compatible
* **PATCH** version (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backwards-compatible

Deprecation Warnings
--------------------

No features are currently deprecated.

When features are deprecated, they will:

1. Remain functional in current MAJOR version
2. Issue ``DeprecationWarning`` when used
3. Include migration instructions in warning message
4. Be documented in this changelog
5. Be removed in next MAJOR version

Upgrade Guide
-------------

From 0.4.x to 0.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No breaking changes. All existing code should continue to work.

New feature usage:

.. code-block:: python

   # Two-phase output now available in CLI
   sandlercubics state -T 180 -P 3.0 -eos pr -n methane --phase both

From 0.3.x to 0.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No breaking changes. New vaporization properties are optional.

From 0.2.x to 0.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New SRK equation available:

.. code-block:: python

   from sandlercubics.eos import SoaveRedlichKwongEOS
   
   eos = SoaveRedlichKwongEOS(Tc, Pc, omega)

From 0.1.x to 0.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* CLI now requires explicit subcommand (``state`` or ``delta``)
* Old: ``sandlercubics -T 400 -P 0.5 ...``
* New: ``sandlercubics state -T 400 -P 0.5 ...``
